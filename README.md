# Burger
### A burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM.

Burger allows a user to add a burger by entering it in the form field, and then allows them to choose to either 'devour it' or 'serve it' again by selecting the respective button.  Depending on which of the buttons is pressed, the burger is moved to the corresponding side of the screen.

## Motivation
Burger is a full-stack app, which complies with the guidelines of:
* Utilizing npm packages to access and format data.
* Establishing a package.json for npm package version info and install requirements.
* Using Express for server functionality.
* It follows the Model, View, Controller (MVC) design pattern
* Uses Node and MySQL to query and route data
* Uses Handlebars to generate HTML
* Deploying to GitHub.
* Deploying to Heroku.

## Project Usefulness
This web app is useful as a tool for working with server data data through interaction and form input from a user.  It provides an example of how npm packages can be utilized to assist in connecting to a server, how Node and MySQL can be used to query and route data, and how Handlebars can be used to generate HTML.
